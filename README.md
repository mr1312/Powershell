# Powershell
Michael's PowerShell projects
Note 
New_Test.csv 
Is a test user you can upload to your manager server to prove that the code works. 
However AD [Path] will need to be changed as it references ADUser.Mike.local and mike.local is where the domain goes 

Mikes_Script
Tested versions 
Windows-Server (2019 64bit)
Allows the user to choose between Optimizing the hardrive and uploading a user onto AD server. This is done through an csv file there isnt a way to directly upload a user straight from the command without a use of a file. 

Note - Has been tested to work without admin privilages however permissions may change depending on local group policy.
